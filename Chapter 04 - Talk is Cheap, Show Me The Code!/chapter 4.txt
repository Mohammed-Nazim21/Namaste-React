# Different ways of Writing CSS
How to write inline styles in JSX?
unlike in HTML, styles in JSX are given by using JavaScript objest

const styleCard = {
  backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0",
};

const RestaurantCard = () => {
  return (
    <div className="res-card" style={styleCard}>
      <h3>Res Name</h3>
    </div>
  );
};

Inline styles in not preferred way to write code

# How to make Cards dynamic?
-> using props

# Props
When we want to pass in data dynamically to component, we pass it as a props
- We can pass any number of props
- we can destructure props on the fly
const {resName, cuisine} = props

# Config Driven UI

# Optional Chaining in JavaScript

# JavaScript Map Function

{resList.map((restaurant) => (
          <RestaurantCard resData={restaurant} />
        ))}

# React Feature

> Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.

## Why we need Keys?
**Never use Indexes as keys
