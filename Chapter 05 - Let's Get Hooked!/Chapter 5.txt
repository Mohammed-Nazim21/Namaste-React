React Advantages: 
- Everything we can do with React, can also be done with normal HTML, CSS and JavaScript


File Structure:
https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html
- Best practice is to make separate files for separate components
- Component file name should be same as the Component name

	- src
	    - components
		- Header.js
		- Body.js
		- RestaurantCard.js
	    - utils
		- constants.js
		- mockData.js

# Exporting data 
- There are two types of import/export
	1- Default Export/Import (normal export)
		-> export default (name of variable/component)
		-> import component from "path";

	2- Named export -> used when we have to export mutliple things from the same file
		-> export const Component;
		-> import {Component} from "path";

[Homework]
Can we use default export along with a Named export?

# Making Our Site Dynamic (Interactive)
- Create a button to get top rated restaurant (filter)
	- How to add clickhandler? (find out how to do it in JS)
-> In React: using onClick attribute 
<button className="filter-btn" 
	onClick={() => {
            console.log("Button Clicked");
          }}>
          Top Rated Restaurant
        </button>

Timestamp - 1:01:40 -> Very IMPORTANT TOPIC
In React app there is a UI layer and a Data layer
- UI layer will display what is being sent by the Data layer

 listOfRestaurants = listOfRestaurants.filter(
              (res) => res.data.data.avgRating > 4
            );

Filter is working but UI is not updated. How to update the UI?

React super power
- React is fast and efficient in DOM manipulation
- React and all other frameworks try to make the UI and Data layer work with each other in sync

React Hook
- React Hook is a normal JavaScript utility function which is provided by React
- To use them, we have to import the hooks using Named imports
	- import { useState } from "react";

- Most Important Hooks -> useState() and useEffect()

useState() -> To create state variable in React
	- State variables maintains the state of the component

// Local State Variable - super powerful variable
  const [listOfRestaurants] = useState();
  // Normal JS variable
  // let listOfRestaurants;


Whenever a state variable updates, React re-renders the component.
This in React makes DOM operations fast and efficient. This is why React is fast
React keeps the data layre insync with the UI layer - How?
