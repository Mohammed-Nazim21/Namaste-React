To execute the project
$ npx parcel index.html -> will create a dev build for us

Creating a script to start our project. Scripts are made in package.json file

"scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html"
  },
Now instead of writing npx parcel index.html we can use the command 
$ npm run start -> it will run npx parcel index.html and start our project

This is Standard followed in the industry
 
We can also just write "$ npm start", this will also work since start is a keyword in npm
But "$ npm build" won't work. Have to use the "run" command

# JSX
- Javascript syntax which helps us to create React element easily
- JSX is not part of react
- we can write React without JSX also
- JSX is a convention in which JS and HTML is merged But JSX is not HTML inside Javascript
- JSX is HTML like syntax
- Attributes in JSX have to be written in camel case
- Home Work -> Find out how to write various tag inside JSX
- To write multiline JSX we wrap it inside Braces '()' so Babel can know where JSX starts and ends

# Babel https://babeljs.io/

# How to create nested elements

const HeadingComponent1 = () => {
  return (
    <div id="container">
      <h1>React Functional Component</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

# Hwo to Render a React function component
root.render(<HeadingComponent1 />); -> This syntax is understood by Babel that this is a functional component

# Special feature in JSX
-> In JSX, by using curly braces '{}', we can write any javascript expression (but not statements) inside the curly braces
Writing JavaScript inside JSX is a very powerful thing

# JSX also takes care of XSS attacks
